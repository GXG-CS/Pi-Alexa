# Data Collection Scripts Analysis

## Overview

This document provides an overview and analysis of three Python scripts found within the `data_collection` directory, extracted from `data_collection.zip`. These scripts are part of a project focused on network traffic analysis and audio recording, potentially for analyzing interactions with devices like Alexa Echo Dot.

## 1. `detect_traffic.py`

### Purpose
The script uses the Scapy library for network traffic analysis, specifically monitoring traffic related to a specified IP address.

### Key Components
- **start_traffic_detection Function**: Main function to start traffic detection.
- **Traffic Detection Logic**: Analyzes network packets to count those related to the specified IP.
- **Packets Per Second Calculation**: Calculates packets per second for monitored IP traffic.
- **is_target_packet Function**: Checks if a packet is related to the specified IP.

## 2. `recording.py`

### Purpose
Implements audio recording using the PyAudio library.

### Key Components
- **record_audio Function**: Primary function for recording audio.
- **Audio Recording Setup**: Sets up parameters like format, channels, sample rate, and frames per buffer.
- **Recording Process**: Records audio for a specified duration and stores the data.
- **Saving Recorded Audio**: Saves the audio as a WAV file.

## 3. `data_collection.py`

### Purpose
Integrates the functionalities of traffic detection and potentially audio recording.

### Key Components
- **Importing Functions**: Imports traffic detection and potentially audio recording functions.
- **Parameters for Detection and Recording**: Defines network interface and IP address to monitor, with placeholders for audio recording parameters.
- **monitor_traffic_and_record Function**: Initiates traffic detection in a separate thread.
- **Thread Management and Conditional Logic**: Uses threading for independent traffic detection and placeholders for event-based triggers.
- **Flexibility for Further Development**: Structured for easy addition of further logic and integration.

## Conclusion
The scripts are part of a system designed to monitor network traffic and potentially trigger audio recordings in response to specific network events, likely for analyzing interactions with Alexa Echo Dot devices.
