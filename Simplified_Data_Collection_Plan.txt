Data Collection Plan: Simple Version

Objective: 
To collect and analyze WiFi traffic data from an Alexa Echo Dot using a Raspberry Pi configured as a WiFi router and data collector.

Steps:
1. Configure Raspberry Pi:
   - Set up the Raspberry Pi as a WiFi router.
   - Ensure it can monitor and capture WiFi traffic data.
2. Detect Alexa Echo Dot Traffic:
   - Identify the Alexa Echo Dot's WiFi traffic based on its IP address.
   - Use network analysis tools or scripts to capture relevant data.
3. Use Tacotron2 for Speech Synthesis:
   - Implement Tacotron2 to convert text (C) into speech (A).
   - Prepare the necessary computational resources and expertise.
4. Interaction and Data Capture:
   - Play the synthesized speech to the Alexa Echo Dot.
   - Simultaneously capture the WiFi traffic data generated during this interaction.

Considerations:
- Ensure accurate identification of the Alexa Echo Dot's IP address.
- Optimize the Raspberry Pi for continuous data monitoring.
- Validate the quality of the synthesized speech for clarity and naturalness.
- Record the timing and details of each data capture session for analysis.

Data Analysis:
- Analyze the captured WiFi traffic data to understand interaction patterns.
- Correlate audio inputs (speech) with variations in WiFi traffic.
